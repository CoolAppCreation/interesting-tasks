func checkCityTime(_ cityOne: [String], _ cityTwo: [String], _ cityThree: [String], _ timeInFirstCity: Int) -> String{
    let differenceInTime = (Int(cityTwo[0])! - Int(cityOne[0])!, Int(cityThree[0])! - Int(cityOne[0])!)
    return "If in \(cityOne[1]) is \(timeInFirstCity) o'clock, so in \(cityTwo[1]) is \(timeInFirstCity + differenceInTime.0) o'clock and in \(cityThree[1]) is \(timeInFirstCity + differenceInTime.1) o'clock"
