Task #4
Question: we have collection of numbers and some number. We must find two numbers in our collection, which summary equal
to number which we set. If there are not such numbers, we must find some number, which in summary with first number of collection equal
to number which we set.
I post my solution of this task and you can propose your solution or show my mistakes. Thank you in advance.
