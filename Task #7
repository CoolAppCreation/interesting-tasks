Task #7
Question: we have max weight, which truck can carry, weight of one container and number of containers. We must calculate how many
trucks we need for this order and say: is this order profitable?
I post my solution of this task and you can propose your solution or show my mistakes. Thank you in advance.

    let totalWeightOfContainers = weightOfOneContainer * numberOfContainers

    if Int(String(totalWeightOfContainers % maxWeightForTruck).flatMap{Int(String($0))}.first!) == 0{
        truckFullOrNot = "it will be good order, because all trucks are filled"
    }else{
        truckFullOrNot = "it will be bad order, because not all trucks are filled"
    }
    return "For this order we need \((totalWeightOfContainers / maxWeightForTruck) + Int(String(totalWeightOfContainers / maxWeightForTruck).flatMap{Int(String($0))}.first!)) trucks. In conclusion, \(truckFullOrNot)"
