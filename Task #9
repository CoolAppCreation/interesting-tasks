func timeForDeparting(_ firstTripTime: Int, _ timeBetweenTrip: Double, _ passengerNumber: Int, _ totalPassengerForOneTrip: Int) -> String{
    var countTrip = passengerNumber / totalPassengerForOneTrip
    if passengerNumber % totalPassengerForOneTrip > 0{
        countTrip += 1
    }
    let countTime = Double(8) + (Double(countTrip) * timeBetweenTrip)
    return "If passenger number is \(passengerNumber), his boat will depart at \(countTime)"
